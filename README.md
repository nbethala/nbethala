## Hi there 👋

### 👩‍💻 About Me
🌍 I'm Nancy Bethala — a global tech explorer who's lived on three continents (Asia, Europe, North America).
   
### 🧰 Languages & Tools
The market currently offers thousands of tools — listing tools alone don’t solve your problems!
I bring hands-on expertise in cloud-native infrastructure, system architecture, and emerging AI/ML workflows to drive impact—always learning, always evolving! 

### 🛠️ Career Pause & Re-engagement
After a planned career break to care for an ill child, I’m actively re-engaging with hands-on cloud native projects, portfolio documentation, and upskilling in Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, System design and AI/ML workflows.

To anyone reading this who’s taken a career break — don’t let it be a breaker of your career. You’ve done it once. You’ll do it again. And this time, you’ll do it with clarity, resilience, and purpose!

### 🚀 Current Technical Focus
- Kubernetes Certification (CKA Preparation) 
- Application Modernization & AI/ML Integration

###  ⚡ Fun fact: 
I’ve lived on three continents, slept less than 4+ hours a night, worked across multiple time zones — and still prefer my terminal prompt clean and minimal.
