## About

Infrastructure and systems engineer focused on distributed ML platforms.

I work on systems integration - how networking, compute, memory, and 
orchestration interact under real workloads. My approach: build hands-on, 
measure what breaks, document the solutions.

---

Current focus: GPU inference optimization, multi-model serving, and 
cost-effective LLM architectures on Kubernetes.

Background: Fortune 500 experience with production platforms 
and observable ML systems.

I share everything I build - the working patterns and the failures - 
to help others operating similar infrastructure.
