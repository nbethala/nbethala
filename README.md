## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm Nancy Bethala, born in Hyderabad, Telangana — widely known as India's tech city.

Where I learned my A-B-C: I hold a graduate degree in Molecular Biology from India and a postgraduate degree in Computer Science from London, United Kingdom.

Home Sweet Home: I reside in the United States of America — Boston, Massachusetts — proudly a citizen for over two decades. 

## 🧰 Languages & Tools

The market offers thousands of tools — but listing tools alone don’t solve your problems!

**WHAT** is the business challenge? **WHERE** does it occur in the system or workflow? 

**HOW** can we solve it ? 

**...then lets identify the right tools to solve the problem!**

**Don’t worry — I bring the latest in cloud-native infrastructure, data engineering, system architecture, and AI/ML (still learning!) to the table.**

## 🛠️ Career Pause & Re-engagement
After a planned career break to care for an ill child, I’m actively re-engaging with hands-on cloud native projects, portfolio documentation, and upskilling in Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, System design and AI/ML workflows.

To anyone reading this who’s taken a career break — don’t let it be a breaker of your career. You’ve done it once. You’ll do it again. And this time, you’ll do it with clarity, resilience, and purpose!

## 💼 What I Bring to the Table
 14+ years in enterprise SaaS and PaaS environments - curious and an avid self-learner! 

## 🚀 Current Technical Focus
Kubernetes Certification (CKA Preparation) I’m deep into Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) prep — mastering cluster architecture, RBAC, networking, and troubleshooting. My goal? To become the Kube Whisperer — someone who can tame any cluster and bring clarity to chaos.

##  ⚡ Fun fact: 
I’ve lived on three continents, slept less than 4+ hours a night, worked across multiple time zones — and still prefer my terminal prompt clean and minimal. 

I’m a lover of coffees from around the world — ask me about flavor profiles, brewing rituals, or how to make a cup that pairs perfectly with a late-night debugging session (between 12 - 2 am is the magic hour!).
