## Hi there 👋

### 👩‍💻 About Me
🌍 I'm Nancy Bethala — a global tech explorer who's lived on three continents (Asia, Europe, North America).
   
### 🧰 Languages & Tools
The market currently offers thousands of tools — listing tools alone don’t solve your problems!
I bring hands-on expertise in cloud-native infrastructure, DevOps, system architecture, and emerging AI/MLOps workflows to drive impact—always learning, always evolving! 

### 🚀 Current Technical Focus
- Kubernetes Certification (CKA Preparation) 
- Application Modernization & AI/MLOps Integration

###  ⚡ Fun fact: 
I’ve lived on three continents, slept less than 4+ hours a night, worked across multiple time zones — and still prefer my terminal prompt clean and minimal.
